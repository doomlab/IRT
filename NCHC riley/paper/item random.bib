abstract = {Scientists should be able to provide support for the absence of a meaningful effect. Currently, researchers often incorrectly conclude an effect is absent based a nonsignificant result. A widely recommended approach within a frequentist framework is to test for equivalence. In equivalence tests, such as the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure discussed in this article, an upper and lower equivalence bound is specified based on the smallest effect size of interest. The TOST procedure can be used to statistically reject the presence of effects large enough to be considered worthwhile. This practical primer with accompanying spreadsheet and R package enables psychologists to easily perform equivalence tests (and power analyses) by setting equivalence bounds based on standardized effect sizes and provides recommendations to prespecify equivalence bounds. Extending your statistical tool kit with equivalence tests is an easy way to improve your statistical and theoretical inferences.},

@incollection{Frick2001,
abstract = {Whereas in a classical laboratory setting participants often feel obliged to stay and finish the experiment, participants in online studies can leave the session at any time. Although, from an ethical point of view, this is an advantage of online studies, complete voluntary participation might pose methodological problems. Of course, Web experimenters would like their participants to stay until the end of the experiment. To ensure this, they use special techniques. One such technique is to make Web pages shorter, more attractive, and faster loading as the participant continues further in the study. Such a technique works to increase a participants interest and enjoyment and may result in fewer drop outs during the most important part of the study. If a Web page has a long loading time at the beginning, participants with minimal interest or little time may leave right away without even starting the experiment. This high hurdle technique is particularly effective in combination with a warm-up phase (Reips, 1996, 1999, 2001) to eliminate those who may drop out up front. A second frequently used technique to prevent participants from leaving is to initially announce a lottery with prizes, in which only those who finish the experiment can take part. Whether or not this procedure is a successful method to reduce the drop out rate in online studies has never been examined experimentally. In a study on material (nonmonetary) incentives in mail surveys, Nederhof (1983) found that incentives did not increase the response rates but did increase the speed of return. Thus, one might argue that promising financial incentives is negligible in reducing drop out or might even reduce the intrinsic motivation of the potential participant (Deci, 1975). A survey among 21 Web experimenters recently conducted by Musch and Reips (2000) suggests that incentives do play a role in reducing drop out in online studies. They found a clear link between lack of financial incentives and drop out rate. A monetary prize might diminish drop out tendency whenever intrinsically motivating factors are not sufficient. In some studies on mail surveys, a similar effect could be found. For example, James and Bolstein (1992) found response rates of 79.3{\%} when participants received a 20 check, whereas in the control condition (no incentives) only 52.0{\%} returned the questionnaire. Similar results might be found if drop out were used as the dependent variable. The Web experiment at hand has been conducted to further investigate the causal nature of the relationship between financial incentives and drop out under completely voluntary conditions: In online studies. We expected a lower drop out rate when a lottery is announced at the beginning of the experiment. Another issue that should be considered is the possibility that the use of incentives could bias the participants answers. The promise of incentives might attract a certain group of participants (Rosenthal {\&} Rosnow, 1975), and it might influence participants answers. Rush, Phillips, and Panek (1978) found that two samples of volunteer subjects recruited from the same population by different means (paid/unpaid) differed significantly on ability, personality and task-related performance. The participants who had volunteered for their study and received no financial remuneration were more likely to be field dependent and could be characterized by a higher social-interpersonal orientation. Samples of paid volunteers, on the other hand, committed more errors of omission on a dichotic listening task. In analogy to different recruitment methods, presence or absence of incentives might lead to similar differences and different answering behavior. Most studies contain a few questions potentially revealing the responder's identity. Questions about gender, age, or address reduce the participants' impression of anonymity. In our view, perceived loss of anonymity leads to a higher self-commitment, in the sense of: I just gave away all this information about myself, therefore this study must be worth finishing. Compliance with all aspects of the study should be better. Consequently, we designed the present Web experiment to test the hypothesis that asking participants for personal information early in the experiment would lead to decreased drop out and a lower non-response rate. So far, a study conducted offline by Giles and Feild (1978) failed to find any effects of the placement of demographic items. In their study, however, they mailed out questionnaires and measured the response rates. Mailed questionnaires can be answered in any order, therefore one wouldn't expect effects due to the positioning of questions (cf., Schwarz {\&} Hippler, 1995; Reips, in press). The situation is different in WWW questionnaires with only one or very few questions per Web page: Participants cannot look ahead or determine their own response order. Whether demographic data should be assessed at the beginning of an experiment or at the end is an issue of high relevance in online research, as one's choice might create systematic drop out and lower data quality. Finally, beyond systematic biases introduced by drop out and non- response behaviors, asking for personal information at the beginning of a study could also directly influence answering behavior in questions that are likely to be influenced by social desirability. Participants answers might be more strongly influenced by social norms if they believed they could be identified (e. g., through their E-mail address). For example, Satow (1975) found a strong (negative) effect of privacy on helping behavior. Conclusions This experiment has shown that (1) financial incentives can reduce drop out; (2) assessing participants personal information at the beginning of an experiment can reduce drop out and may lead to more complete demographic data about the participants; (3) these positive effects can be reached without biasing the data; and (4) the language and order in which items are presented can influence answering behavior.},

abstract = {For survey researchers, it is common practice to use the check-all question format in Web and mail surveys but to convert to the forced-choice question format in telephone surveys. The assumption underlying this practice is that respondents will answer the two formats similarly. In this research note we report results from 16 experimental comparisons in two Web surveys and a paper survey conducted in 2002 and 2003 that test whether the check-all and forced-choice formats pro-duce similar results. In all 16 comparisons, we find that the two question formats do not perform similarly; respondents endorse more options and take longer to answer in the forced-choice format than in the check-all format. These findings suggest that the forced-choice question format encourages deeper processing of response options and, as such, is pref-erable to the check-all format, which may encourage a weak satisficing response strategy. Additional analyses show that neither acquiescence bias nor item nonresponse seem to pose substantial problems for use of the forced-choice question format in Web surveys.},

abstract = {Portfolio balancing requires estimates of covariance between asset returns. Returns data have histories which greatly vary in length, since assets begin public trading at different times. This can lead to a huge amount of missing data--too much for the conventional imputation-based approach. Fortunately, a well-known factorization of the MVN likelihood under the prevailing historical missingness pattern leads to a simple algorithm of OLS regressions that is much more reliable. When there are more assets than returns, however, OLS becomes unstable. Gramacy, et al. (2008), showed how classical shrinkage regression may be used instead, thus extending the state of the art to much bigger asset collections, with further accuracy and interpretation advantages. In this paper, we detail a fully Bayesian hierarchical formulation that extends the framework further by allowing for heavy-tailed errors, relaxing the historical missingness assumption, and accounting for estimation risk. We illustrate how this approach compares favorably to the classical one using synthetic data and an investment exercise with real returns. An accompanying R package is on CRAN.},

abstract = {The statistical test of hypothesis of no difference between the average bioavailabilities of two drug formulations, usually supplemented by an assessment of what the power of the statistical test would have been if the true averages had been inequivalent, continues to be used in the statistical analysis of bioavailability/bioequivalence studies. In the present article, this Power Approach (which in practice usually consists of testing the hypothesis of no difference at level 0.05 and requiring an estimated power of 0.80) is compared to another statistical approach, the Two One-Sided Tests Procedure, which leads to the same conclusion as the approach proposed by Westlake based on the usual (shortest) 1-2 alpha confidence interval for the true average difference. It is found that for the specific choice of alpha = 0.05 as the nominal level of the one-sided tests, the two one-sided tests procedure has uniformly superior properties to the power approach in most cases. The only cases where the power approach has superior properties when the true averages are equivalent correspond to cases where the chance of concluding equivalence with the power approach when the true averages are not equivalent exceeds 0.05. With appropriate choice of the nominal level of significance of the one-sided tests, the two one-sided tests procedure always has uniformly superior properties to the power approach. The two one-sided tests procedure is compared to the procedure proposed by Hauck and Anderson.},

To date many different models have been described, with limited evidence to support whether they are replicable. This study utilized data from undergraduates (N = 620) from a medium-sized university located in the southern United States. Ten different PIL models were tested, with support found for the two-factor model (exciting life, purposeful life) of Morgan and Farsides.

abstract = {(from the book) In the pages of this handbook, you will find descriptions of many techniques that psychologists and others have developed to help them pursue a shared understanding of why humans think, feel, and behave the way they do. These are the tools that we use to conduct our rational analyses. At the broadest level, when choosing a method you make decisions about (a) what data or measurement techniques will best capture the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that interest you; (b) what research design best fits the question that you want to answer; and (c) what strategies for data analysis best match the characteristics of your design and measurements. The simplest choice for organizing the presentation of material is the temporal sequence in which you will make these decisions. This is roughly what we have done. In Volume 2, interpretive research designs that emphasize a qualitative approach are detailed in Part I. Volume 2, Parts II through VI, introduces designs that emphasize an etic (or theory-specified), more quantitative approach to research. In Volume 2, Part V, designs are introduced that focus on theory-testing questions, rely heavily on quantification, and are used to study change in individual units. The designs in Volume 2, Part VI, are labeled "Neuropsychology" and "Biological Psychology." Here you will find designs for theory-driven research that derive largely from the more biological end of psychology's family tree. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)},

The sample was composed of 341 undergraduate students from a medium-sized university located in the southern United States of America. The total scores of the measures were found to be internally consistent. Two subscales of the MIST were found to have questionable reliability. The PIL and the LPQ, both general measures of meaning, appear to have comparable psychometric properties. The PIL and the LPQ share 64{\%} common variance and are similarly correlated with the remaining measures of meaning and the OQ-45.2. However, the LPQ tended to be preferred by respondents in many respects.},

Questions from two surveys are evaluated by six expert reviewers using a standardized evaluation form. Each of the questions has validation data available from records. Large inconsistencies in ratings across the six experts are found. Despite the lack of reliability, the average expert ratings successfully identify questions that had higher item nonresponse rates and higher levels of inaccurate reporting. This article provides empirical evidence that experts are able to discern questions that manifest data quality problems, even if individual experts vary in what they rate as being problematic. Compared to a publicly available computerized question evaluation tool, ratings by the human experts positively predict questions with data quality problems, whereas the computerized tool varies in success in identifying these questions. These results indicate that expert reviews have value in identifying question problems that result in lower survey data quality.},

The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2-index presentation strategy is re- quired to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true-population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML-based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true-population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small.},

@article{Henrich2010,
abstract = {Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world's top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers – often implicitly – assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these " standard subjects " are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species – frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior – hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

The first section, Internet-Based Research, narrates the short history of Internet-based data-collection methods in psychological research, describes their characteristics, and presents a systematic overview of the four basic types of methods. Some notions about planning Internet based research lead to the second section, Generating a Web Experiment. The section describes an example and provides the reader with the opportunity to become active and experience Internet-based data-collection methods by creating and conducting a web experiment in a step-by-step fashion. The example introduces the important concepts of client-side versus server-side processing and illustrates a number of important techniques. The third section, Pretesting, emphasizes the need to take extra care in preparing the materials and procedure and evaluating their usability. Useful procedures in pretesting of Internet-based data collection are introduced, and the section explains how these procedures prevent methodological problems. In the fourth section, Recruitment, the pros and cons of various ways of attracting participants to Internet based studies are explained, concluding with the use of games as research environments on the Internet. The Data Analysis section explains a number of important issues such as raw data preservation, paradata, inclusion criteria, and technical variance. Furthermore, the section introduces several specific methods, including log file analysis. The concluding section looks at future trends and the continuing evolution of Internet-based methods and their use in behavioral and social research.

@article{Kass1995a,
abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In ''nonstandard'' statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factor; than to derive non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIG) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the history of Web-based research experiments. The computerized experimenting was first introduced in 1970s. It revolutionized traditional laboratory research with its attractive new features such as standardized and controlled presentation of stimuli, item-branching capabilities, immediacy of data entry, elimination of missing responses, elimination of transcription costs and errors, and accurate measurements of response times. Today, most human experimental research in psychology is aided by computer automation. Usage of extending computerized experimenting beyond single PCs, local computer networks is collecting data rapidly and programs are being written in high-level languages such as C++, Pascal, or Delphi, or with program packages such as Super-Lab, Psy-Scope and MEL to optimize the data collecting tools in order to get quality data. Although, at the moment, the number of Web experiments is still small, a rapid growth can be predicted on the basis of the present result.},

The present study compares paper and Internet administrations of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) Scale (Wallston {\&} Wallston, 1981). In terms of reliabilities and factor structures, the Internet data were found to be at least as good as the paper data. MHLC scores were comparable for paper and Internet administrations, although the Internet sample scored significantly lower on the Powerful Others subscale. Overall, the results show that administration of the MHLC Scale via the Internet can produce data comparable to that obtained by pen-and-paper methods. However, it is concluded that generalization of these findings beyond the psychometric test instrument and sampling procedures used here is not warranted.},

abstract = {Investigation of the underlying mechanisms responsible for measurement variance has received little attention. The primary objective of this study is to examine whether paper and social media surveys produce convergent results and investigate the underlying psychological mechanisms for the potential measurement nonequivalence. Particularly, we explored the role of social desirability and satisficing on the measurement results. We collected data via five different survey modes, including paper survey, ad hoc Web survey, online forum (message boards)-based, SNS-based and microblog-based surveys. The findings show that socially desirable responding does not lead to inconsistent results. Rather we found that satisficing causes inconsistent results in paper versus online surveys. Sociability reduces the possibility of engaging in satisficing that results in inconsistent results between traditional Web surveys and social media-based Web surveys. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The study examined the quality and utility of online administration of the Self-Directed Search (SDS) to high school students in a career exploration workshop. An Internet-based SDS version was designed; it included automatic scoring and immediate feedback to test takers, providing a three-letter occupational code along with verbal explanation of the results. SDS was taken by participants in their homes or in school (n = 77), and compared to traditional administration of the SDS (n = 73), either self-scored or counselor scored. The mean internal consistency coefficient for the SDS was .90, and mean test-retest reliability (over a 6- week period) was .94. Mean correlation between the same SDS scales of participants who took both versions was .77. For this latter group, the Realistic, Social, and Enterprising scales were found to be higher in the online administration than in the paper-and-pencil administration, whereas the three other scales were not statistically different. Similar to the traditional version and consistent with previous research, the online version produced the configuration of a RIASEC-order hexagon. Participants who took the online version were more satisfied with it than those who took the paper-and-pencil version. These results highly support the further use of the online version of the SDS.},

Data from 3 different projects illustrate such (substantive) differences, and the errors that would result from using established norms to interpret internet-mediated assessments.

abstract = {AIM: This paper is a report of a study to evaluate the use of an online data collection method to survey early survivors of childhood cancer about their physical and psychosocial characteristics and health-related quality of life. BACKGROUND: A major advantage in conducting web-based nursing research is the ability to involve participants who are challenging to study because of their small numbers or inaccessibility because of geographic location. As paediatric oncology patients and early survivors of childhood cancer are often not easily accessible because of their small numbers at single institutions, web-based research methods have been proposed as a potentially effective approach to collect data in studies involving these clinical populations. METHOD: Guided by published literature on using the Internet for data collection, an online protocol was developed; this included construction of a website, development of a homepage and interactive HyperText Markup Language pages and the posting of the study link on various websites. Data collection occurred over a 6-month period between December 2005 and May 2006. FINDINGS: Despite using strategies in conducting online research cited in published literature, the recruitment of subjects was very prolonged and the volume of missing data among many respondents excluded them from the study and created bias within the study's results. CONCLUSION: Web-based, online data collection methods create opportunities to conduct research globally, especially among difficult to access populations. However, web-based research requires careful consideration of how the study will be advertised and how data will be collected to ensure high quality data and validity of the findings.},

However, very few recommendations exist for applying tests of equivalence. A Monte Carlo study was used to compare the test of equivalence proposed by Schuirmann with the traditional Student t test for deciding if two group means are equivalent. It was found that Schuirmann's test of equivalence is more effective than Student's t test at detecting population mean equivalence with large sample sizes; however, Schuirmann's test of equivalence performs poorly relative to Student's t test with small sample sizes and/or inflated variances.},

abstract = {An increasing proportion of information technology (IT)/information system adoption research collects data using online surveys. However, a paucity of research assesses the equivalence of paper-based versus Internet-based surveys in collectivistic cultures. Furthermore, no theoretical or empirical research investigates how cultural differences between collectivistic and individualistic cultures influence the measurement equivalence (ME) of these survey modes. To explore these issues, online and paper-based surveys with comparable samples were carried out in both an individualistic (the USA) and a collectivistic culture (China). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to examine the ME across both survey modes in these different cultures. Results indicate that the relatively larger satisficing discrepancy between paper and online surveys causes respondents in collectivistic cultures to have an increased likelihood of providing responses that vary as compared to respondents in individualistic cultures. The disparate responses, in turn, result in increased measurement variance between the two survey modes. The findings of this study bridge a gap in the literature and address the question of how culture influences online satisficing behaviour and how that behaviour causes measurement invariance across survey modes. This study also explains the possible underlying mechanisms by which different national cultures exert their influence on survey results. The findings provide important implications for IT researchers, especially those in collectivistic cultures or those who need to collect data in collectivistic cultures using online surveys or mixed-mode surveys that include an online survey mode.

abstract = {Developed, on the basis of responses from 608 undergraduate students to the 33-item Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, three short forms of 11, 12, and 13 items. The psychometric characteristics of these three forms and three other short forms developed by Strahan and Gerbasi (1972) were investigated and comparisons made. Results, in the form of internal consistency reliability, item factor loadings, short form with Marlowe-Crowne total scale correlations, and correlations between Marlowe-Crowne short forms and the Edwards Social Desirability Scale, indicate that psychometrically sound short forms can be constructed. Comparisons made between the short forms examined in this investigation suggest the 13-item form as a viable substitute for the regular 33-item Marlowe-Crowne scale.},

Few published studies have investigated the differences between Web-based data and data collected with more traditional methods. In order to investigate these potential differences, two important factors were crossed in this study: whether the data were collected on line or not and whether the data were collected in a group setting at a fixed time or individually at a time of the respondent's choosing. The Visions of Morality scale (Shelton {\&} McAdams, 1990) was used, and the participants were assigned to one of four conditions: in-class Web survey, in-class paper-and-pencil survey; take-home Web survey, and take-home paper-and-pencil survey. No significant differences in scores were found for any condition; however, response rates were affected by the type of survey administered, with the take-home Web-based instrument having the lowest response rate. Therefore, researchers need to be aware that different modes of administration may affect subject attrition and may, therefore, confound investigations of other independent variables.},

abstract = {Responding to suggestions of prior research for examining the psychological constructs involved in a decision for or against participation in web surveys, this paper investigated the effects of trust in sponsor and personal innovativeness on potential respondents' participation intention. Based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), two alternative models were empirically tested in which the roles of trust and innovativeness were theorized differently-either as moderators of the effects which perceived behavioral control and attitude have on participation intention (moderator model) or as direct determinants of the attitude, perceived behavioral control and intention (direct effects model). Data was collected from a sample of 131 university students enrolled in a computer course. The results of our study indicated that: (1) TPB could satisfactorily predict the behavioral intention with up to 44{\%} variation of the intention being predicted by the model; (2) trust in sponsor and personal web innovativeness exerted direct determinant effects rather than moderate effects on participation attitude and perceived behavioral control, which in turn significantly affected participation intention; and (3) integrating the variables of trust and personal innovativeness into TPB model enhanced the prediction effect. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {At first sight, web surveys seem to be an interesting and attractive means of data collection. They provide simple, cheap, and fast access to a large group of potential respondents. However, web surveys are not without methodological problems. Specific groups in the populations are under-represented because they have less access to Internet. Furthermore, recruitment of respondents is often based on self-selection. Both under-coverage and self-selection may lead to biased estimates. This paper describes these methodological problems. It also explores the effect of various correction techniques (adjustment weighting and use of reference surveys). This all leads to the question whether properly design web surveys can be used for data collection. The paper attempts to answer this question. It concludes that under-coverage problems may solve itself in the future, but that self-selection leads to unreliable survey outcomes},

The data examined were from a previous study that had examined the persuasiveness of health-related messages. To the extent that Internet data would be based on a sample at least as representative as data derived from a traditional student sample, it was expected that the two methodologies would yield equivalent data. Using formal tests of equivalence on persuasion outcomes, hypotheses of equivalence were generally supported. Additionally, the Internet sample was more diverse demographically than the student sample, identifying Internet samples as a valid alternative for future experimental research},

In an attempt to remediate this area of weakness, two groups of such children (mean ages 9;4 and 10;6) received about 55 half-hour sessions of metalinguistic training spread over 12 months. Results showed that the use of complex sentences increased to at least normal levels in the experimental groups, and were significantly improved, at both the written and oral levels, as compared with SLI control groups, which evidenced little change over the same period. Further analysis of the data revealed the striking finding that those children who had the poorest complex sentence usage tended to benefit the most from metalinguistic training. These results are interpreted as support for the hypothesis that metalinguistic training helps to overcome the presumed neurological deficit of the language disordered child by making linguistic rules conscious, and thereby providing a 'metalinguistic bridge' via which information can bypass the damaged area.},

These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.},

abstract = {Self-report survey-based data collection is increasingly carried out using the Internet, as opposed to the traditional paper-and-pencil method. However, previous research on the equivalence of these methods has yielded inconsistent findings. This may be due to methodological and statistical issues present in much of the literature, such as nonequivalent samples in different conditions due to recruitment, participant self-selection to conditions, and data collection procedures, as well as incomplete or inappropriate statistical procedures for examining equivalence. We conducted 2 studies examining the equivalence of paper-and-pencil and Internet data collection that accounted for these issues. In both studies, we used measures of personality, social desirability, and computer self-efficacy, and, in Study 2, we used personal growth initiative to assess quantitative equivalence (i.e., mean equivalence), qualitative equivalence (i.e., internal consistency and intercorrelations), and auxiliary equivalence (i.e., response rates, missing data, completion time, and comfort completing questionnaires using paper-and-pencil and the Internet). Study 1 investigated the effects of completing surveys via paper-and-pencil or the Internet in both traditional (i.e., lab) and natural (i.e., take-home) settings. Results indicated equivalence across conditions, except for auxiliary equivalence aspects of missing data and completion time. Study 2 examined mailed paper-and-pencil and Internet surveys without contact between experimenter and participants. Results indicated equivalence between conditions, except for auxiliary equivalence aspects of response rate for providing an address and completion time. Overall, the findings show that paper-and-pencil and Internet data collection methods are generally equivalent, particularly for quantitative and qualitative equivalence, with nonequivalence only for some aspects of auxiliary equivalence.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the role of individuals' beliefs about their abilities to competently use computers (computer self-efficacy) in the determination of computer use. A survey of Canadian managers and professionals was conducted to develop and validate a measure of computer self-efficacy and to assess both its impacts and antecedents. Computer self-efficacy was found to exert a significant influence on individuals' expectations of the outcomes of using computers, their emotional reactions to computers (affect and anxiety), as well as their actual computer use. An individual's self-efficacy and outcome expectations were found to be positively influenced by the encouragement of others in their work group, as well as others' use of computers. Thus, self-efficacy represents an important individual trait, which moderates organizational influences (such as encouragement and support) on an individual's decision to use computers. Understanding self-efficacy, then, is important to the successful implementation of systems in organizations. The existence of a reliable and valid measure of self-efficacy makes assessment possible and should have implications for organizational support, training, and implementation.},

The Internet and previously published samples were psychometrically equivalent. Coefficient alpha values calculated on the matched Internet sample yielded reliability coefficients almost identical to those for the previously published sample. Factors such as computer administration and uncontrollable administration settings did not appear to affect the results. Demographic data indicated an overrepresentation of males by about 6{\%} and Caucasians by about 13{\%} relative to the U.S. Census (2000).

abstract = {Does the manifestation of response set effects in World-Wide Web (WWW) questionnaire responses differ from that in paper-and-pencil (PP) questionnaire responses? 2,649 volunteers responded to a WWW questionnaire, and 458 volunteers responded to a PP questionnaire consisting of 5 personality scales. Five response sets were examined. For 4 of them--random response, item nonresponse, extreme response, and acquiescent response--no statistically significant differences between PP and WWW data were found. The PP administration elicited a statistically higher number of errors (uncodable responses). An analysis of interitem and interscale correlations did not differentiate WWW and PP data. Data from the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, the Perfectionist Self-Presentation Scale, and the Computer Anxiety Scale did not differentiate WWW and PP data in terms of either means or scale reliabilities. It was concluded that WWW data may be comparable to PP data and that the WWW is a potentially useful and valid data collection tool. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2005 APA, all rights reserved)},

@article{Fang2012a,
abstract = {Prior research involving response rates in Web-based surveys has not adequately addressed the effect of the reputation of a sponsoring corporation that contracts with a survey provider. This study investigates the effect of two factors, namely, the reputation of a survey's provider and the reputation of a survey's sponsoring corporation, on the willingness of potential respondents to participate in a Web survey. Results of an experimental design with these two factors reveal that the sponsoring corporation's and the survey provider's strong reputations can induce potential respondents to participate in a Web survey. A sponsoring corporation's reputation has a greater effect on the participation willingness of potential respondents of a Web survey than the reputation of the survey provider. A sponsoring corporation with a weak reputation who contracts with a survey provider having a strong reputation results in increased participation willingness from potential respondents if the identity of the sponsoring corporation is disguised in a survey. This study identifies the most effective strategy to increase participation willingness for a Web-based survey by considering both the reputations of the sponsoring corporation and survey provider and whether to reveal their identities.},

@article{Robitschek2012,
abstract = {The original Personal Growth Initiative Scale (PGIS; Robitschek, 1998) was unidimensional, despite theory identifying multiple components (e.g., cognition and behavior) of personal growth initiative (PGI). The present research developed a multidimensional measure of the complex process of PGI, while retaining the brief and psychometrically sound properties of the original scale. Study 1 focused on scale development, including theoretical derivation of items, assessing factor structure, reducing number of items, and refining the scale length using samples of college students. Study 2 consisted of confirmatory factor analysis with 3 independent samples of college students and community members. Lastly, Study 3 assessed test-retest reliability over 1-, 2-, 4-, and 6-week periods and tests of concurrent and discriminant validity using samples of college students. The final measure, the Personal Growth Initiative Scale-II (PGIS-II), includes 4 subscales: Readiness for Change, Planfulness, Using Resources, and Intentional Behavior. These studies provide exploratory and confirmatory evidence for the 4-factor structure, strong internal consistency for the subscales and overall score across samples, acceptable temporal stability at all assessed intervals, and concurrent and discriminant validity of the PGIS-II. Future directions for research and clinical practice are discussed.},

@article{Fang2012,
abstract = {Little research exists that addresses the equivalence in collectivistic cultures of paper- versus Internet-based surveys. This study addressed this gap and examined the measurement equivalence of individual innovativeness scales between Internet surveys and paper-based surveys within a collectivistic culture (with China serving as our example). The study analyzed and compared survey data from both paper and web-based surveys using confirmatory factor analysis. The assessment of invariance included the levels of configural, metric, scalar, and covariance invariance. The means and variance of latent variables were also compared. The results show that measurements are invariant at the two levels (confi- gural and metric), and the covariances between latent variables are also equivalent, but the mean and variance differences of latent variables are apparent. The results indicate thatwhen conducting research in collectivistic cultures and collecting data from distinct survey modes, researchers should concern themselves with the potential of extreme response patterns and the inclination of social desirability responding, as well as considering the measurement invariance across survey modes.},
