  Scales that are psychometrically sound, meaning those that meet established standards regarding reliability and validity when measuring one or more constructs of interest, are customarily evaluated based on a set modality (i.e., computer or paper) and administration (fixed-item order). Deviating from an established administration profile could result in non-equivalent response patterns, indicating the possible evaluation of a dissimilar construct. Randomizing item administration may alter or eliminate these effects. Therefore, we examined the differences in scale relationships for randomized and nonrandomized computer delivery for two scales measuring meaning/purpose in life. These scales have questions about suicidality, depression, and life goals that may cause item reactivity (i.e. a changed response to a second item based on the answer to the first item). Results indicated that item randomization does not alter scale psychometrics for meaning in life scales, which implies that results are comparable even if researchers implement different delivery modalities.

The use of the Internet has been integrated into daily life as a means of accessing information, interacting with others, and tending to required tasks. The International Telecommunication Union reports that over half the world is online, and 70% of 15-24 year olds are on the internet [@Sanou2017]. Further, the Nielson Total Audience report from 2016 indicates that Americans spend nearly 11 hours a day in media consumption [@Media2016]. Researchers discovered that online data collection can be advantageous over laboratory and paper data collection, as it is often cheaper and more efficient [@Ilieva2001; @Schuldt1994; @Reips2012]. Internet questionnaires first appeared in the early 90s when HTML scripting code integrated form elements, and the first experiments appeared soon after [@Musch2000; @Reips2002a]. The first experimental lab on the internet was the Web Experimental Psychology Lab formed by Reips (http://www.wexlab.eu), and the use of the Internet to collect data has since grown rapidly [@Reips2002a]. What started with email and HTML forms has since moved to whole communities of available participants including websites like Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk and Qualtrics' Participant Panels. Participants of all types and forms are easily accessible for somewhat little to no cost. 

Our ability to collect data on the Internet has inevitably lead to the question of equivalence between in person and online data collection methods [@Meyerson2003; @Buchanan2005]. We will use the term equivalence as a global term for measurement of the same underlying construct between groups, forms, or testing procedures given no other manipulations. A related concept is measurement invariance, which focuses on the statistical and psychometric structure of measurement [Meredith1993; @Brown2006]. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) and multiple-indicators-multiple causes (MIMIC) structural models are often used to explore invariance in groups [@Brown2006; SteenkampBaumgartner1998]. The general approach through MGCFA explores if the latent structure of the proposed model is similar across groups (equal form or configural invariance), followed by more stringent tests indicating equal factor loadings (metric invariance), equal item intercepts (scalar invariance), and potentially, equal error variances (strict invariance). These steps can be used to determine where and how groups differ when providing responses to questionnaires and to propose changes to interpretations of test scores [for an example, see TrentBuchanan2014]. Measurement invariance implies equivalence between examined groups, while overall equivalence studies may not imply the psychometric concept of invariance. 

Research has primarily focused on simple equivalence, with more uptick in research that specifically focuses on measurement invariance with the advent of programs that make such procedures easier. When focusing on equivalence, @Deutskens2006 found that mail surveys and online surveys produce nearly identical results regarding the accuracy of the data collected online versus by mail. Only minor differences arise between online surveys and mail in surveys when it comes to participant honesty and suggestions. For example, participants who responded to surveys online provided more suggestions, lengthier answers, and greater information about competitors in the field that they may prefer [@Deutskens2006]. The hypothesis as to why individuals may be more honest online than in person is that the individual may feel more anonymity and less social desirability effects due to the nature of the online world, therefore less concerned about responding in a socially polite way [@Joinson1999]. A trend found by @Fang2012a shows individuals are more likely to respond to surveys online with extreme scores, rather than mid-range responses on Likert scales due to the lessened social desirability factor. There may be slight cultural differences in responses online. For example, collectivistic cultures showed greater tendency toward mid-range responses on Likert scales via in-person and online due to placing greater value on how they are socially perceived; however, the trend is still the same as scores are more extreme online versus in person or by mail [@Fang2012]. 

Although work by Dillman and his group [@Frick2001; @Smyth2006; @Dillman2008], among others, has shown that many web surveys are plagued by problems of usability, display, coverage, sampling, non-response, or technology, other studies have found internet data to be reliable and almost preferable as it produces a varied demographic response compared to the traditional sample of introduction to psychology college students while also maintaining equivalence [@Lewis2009]. However, equivalence in factor structure may be problematic, as @Buchanan2005 have shown that factor structure was not replicable in online and in person surveys. Other work has shown equivalence using a comparison of correlation matrices [@Meyerson2003] or *t*-tests [@Schulenberg1999; @Schulenberg2001], and the literature is mixed on how different methodologies impact factor structure. @Weigold2013 recently examined both quantitative and research design questions (i.e., missing data) on Internet and paper-and-pencil administration which showed that the administrations were generally equivalent for quantitative structure but research design issues showed non-equivalence. Other potential limitations to online surveys include the accessibility of different populations to the Internet [@Frick2001], selection bias [@Bethlehem2010], response rates [@Cook2000; @Hox1994; @DeLeeuw1988; @Cantrell2007], attrition [@Cronk2002], and distraction [@Tourangeau1999]. Many of these concerns have been alleviated in the years since online surveys were first developed, especially with the advent of panels and Mechanical Turk to reach a large, diverse population of participants [@Buhrmester2011]. 

With the development of advanced online survey platforms such as Qualtrics and Survey Monkey, researchers have the potential to control potentially confounding research design issues through randomization, although other issues may still be present, such as participant misbehavior [@Nosek2002]. Randomization has been a hallmark of good research practice, as the order or presentation of stimuli can be a noise variable in a study with multiple measures [@Keppel2004]. Thus, researchers have often randomized scales by rotating the order of presentation in paper format or simply clicking the randomization button for web-based studies. This practice has counterbalanced out any order effects of going from one scale to the next [@Keppel2004]. However, while scale structure has remained constant, these items are still stimuli within a larger construct. Therefore, these construct-related items have the ability to influence the items that appear later on the survey, which we call item reactivity. For example, a question about being *prepared for death* or *thoughts about suicide* might change the responses to further questions, especially if previous questions did not alert participants to be prepare for that subject matter. 
Scale development typically starts with an underlying latent variable that a researcher wishes to examine through measured items or questions [@DeVellis2016a]. Question design is a well-studied area that indicates that measurement is best achieved through questions that are direct, positively worded, and understandable to the subject [@Dillman2008]. @Olson2010 suggests researchers design a multitude of items in order to investigate and invite subject matter experts to examine these questions. Subject matter experts were found to be variable in their agreement, but excellent at identifying potentially problematic questions. After suggested edits from these experts, a large sample of participant data is collected. While item response theory is gaining traction, classical test theory has dominated this area through the use of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis [EFA, CFA; @Worthington2006]. EFA elucidates several facets of how the measured items represent the latent trait through factor loadings and overall model fit [@Tabachnick2012]. Factor structure represents the correlation between item scores and factors, where a researcher wishes to find items that are strongly related to latent traits. Items that are not related to the latent trait, usually with factor loadings below .300 [@Preacher2003] are discarded. Model fit is examined when simple structure has been achieved (i.e. appropriate factor loadings for each item), and these fit indices inform if the items and factor structure model fit the data well. Well-designed scales include items that are highly related to their latent trait and have excellent fit indices. Scale development additionally includes the examination of other measures of reliability (alpha) and construct validity (relation to other phenomena) but the focus of the scale shifts to subscale or total scores [@Buchanan2014]. Published scales are then distributed for use in the form that is presented in the publication, as item order is often emphasized through important notes about reverse scoring and creating subscale scores. 

The question is no longer whether web-based surveys are reliable sources of data collection; the theory now is in need of a shift to whether or not item-randomization in survey data collection creates psychometric differences. These scale development procedures focus on items, and EFA/CFA statistically try to mimic variance-covariance structure by creating models of the data with the same variance-covariance matrix. If we imagine that stimuli in a classic experimental design can influence the outcome of a study because of their order, then certainly the stimuli on a scale (i.e., the items) can influence the pattern of responses for items. Measuring an attitude or phenomena invokes a reaction in the participant [Knowlescontext]. Often, this reaction or reactivity is treated as error in measurement, rather than a variable to be considered in the experiment [Webb1966]. Potentially, reaction to items on a survey could integrate self-presentation or social desirability [Webb1966] but cognitive factors also contribute to the participant response. Rogers1974 (THIS IS A FROM THE CHAPTER) and Tourangeau1988 suggested a four part integration process that occurs when responses are formulated to questions. First, the participant must interpret the item. The interpretation process usually allows for one construal, and other interpretations may be ignored [Lord1984]. Based on this process, information from memory about the item must be pulled from memory. The avaliability heuristic will bias information found for the next stage, the judgment process, especially given the mood of the participant [Tversky1973; MacLeod1992]. These memories and information, by being recalled as part of answering an item, are often strengthened for future judgments or recall [Posner1978, Bargh1986]. 

The judgment process has important consequences for the answers provided on a questionnaire. Judgments often polarized because of the cognitive processes used to provide that answer [Tesser1978]. The participant may become more committed to the answer provided [Feldman1988], and future judgments are "achored" against this initial judgment [Higgins1983; Strack1985]. Finally, future memory searches will be confirmatory for the judgment decision [Petty1986 A from the book chapter]. The response selection is the final stage of the Rogers1974 and Tourangeau1988 models. This model provides an excellent framework through which to view the consquences of merely being asked a question. In this study, the focus is on the final stage of response selection, as it is the recordable output of these cognitive processes. Knowlescontext discuss that the item order may create a context effect for each subsequent question, wherein participants are likely to confuse the content of an item with the context of the previous questions. Their meaning-change hypothesis posits that each following item will be influenced by the previous set of items and does have important consquences for the factor loadings and reliability of the scale. Indeed, Salaneikcontext indicates that item order creates a specific context that integrates with background knowledge during the answering process, which can create ambiguity in measurement of the interested phenomenon. Pantercontext discuss these effects from classic studies of item ordering, wherein agreement to a specific item first reduces agreement to a more general item second [Strack1987]. 

Given this previous research on item orderings, this study focuses on potential differences in results based on item randomization delivery methodology. This work is especially timely given the relative easy with which randomization can be induced with survey software. The current project examined large samples on two logotherapy-related scales, as these scales include potentially reactive items (e.g., death and suicide items embedded in positive psychology questions), as well as both a dichotomous True/False and traditional 1-7 format for the same items. Large samples were desirable to converge on a stable, representative population; however, false positives (i.e., Type I errors) can occur by using large *N*. Recent developments in the literature focusing on null hypothesis testing make it especially important to present potential alternatives to *p*-values [@Valentine2017]. While a large set of researchers have argued that the literature is full of Type I errors [@Benjamin2017], and thus, the $\alpha$ value should be shifted lower (i.e., *p* < .005 for statistical significance), an equally large set of researchers counter this argument as unfounded and weak [@Lakens2017]. We provide multiple sources of evidence (*p*-values, effect sizes, Bayes Factors, and tests of equivalence) to determine if differences found are not only statistically significant, but also practically significant. In our study, we expand to item randomization for online based surveys, examining the impact on factor loadings, correlation structure, item means, and total scores again providing evidence of difference/non-difference from multiple statistical sources. Finally, we examine these scenarios with a unique set of scales that have both dichotomous True/False and traditional 107 formats to explore how the answer response options might impact any differences found between randomized and nonrandomized methodologies.

# Method

## Participants
The sample population consisted of undergraduate students at a large Midwestern University, placing the approximate age of participants at around 18-22. Table \@ref(tab:demo-table) includes the demographic information about all datasets. Only two scales were used from each dataset, as described below. Participants were generally enrolled in an introductory psychology course that served as a general education requirement for the university. As part of the curriculum, the students were encouraged to participate in psychology research programs, resulting in their involvement in this study. These participants were given course credit for their participation. 

## Materials
Of the surveys included within each larger study, two questionnaires were utilized: the Purpose in Life Questionnaire [PIL; @Crumbaugh1964] and the Life Purpose Questionnaire [LPQ; @Hutzell1988].

### The Purpose in Life Questionnaire
The PIL is a 20-item questionnaire that assesses perceived meaning and life purpose. Items are structured in a 7-point type response format; however, each item has different anchoring points that focus on item content. No items are reverse scored, however, items are presented such that the 7 point end would be equally presented on the left and right when answering. Therefore, these items would need to be reverse coded if computer software automatically codes each item from 1 to 7 in a left to right format. Total scores are created by summing the items, resulting in a range of 20 to 140 for the overall score. The reliability for the scale is generally high, ranging from .70 to .90 [@Schulenberg2004; @Schulenberg2010]. Previous work on validity for the PIL showed viable one- and two-factor models, albeit factor loadings varied across publications [see @Schulenberg2010 for a summary], and these fluctuating results lead to the development of a 4-item PIL short form [@Schulenberg2011]. 

### Life Purpose Questionnaire
The LPQ was modeled after the full 20-item PIL questionnaire, also measuring perceived meaning and purpose in life. The items are structured in a true/false response format, in contrast to the Likert response format found on the PIL. Each question is matched to the PIL with the same item content, altering the question to create binary answer format. After reverse coding, zero on an item would indicate low meaning, while one on an item would indicate high meaning. A total score is created by summing item scores, resulting in a range from 0 to 20. In both scales, higher scores indicated greater perceived meaning in life. Reliability for this scale is also correspondingly high, usually in the .80 range [@Melton2008; @Schulenberg2004].

These two scales were selected because they contained the same item content with differing response formats, which would allow for cross comparisons between results for each scale. 

## Procedure
The form of administration was of interest to this study, and therefore, two formats were included: computerized administration in nonrandom order and computerized administration with a randomized question order. Computerized questionnaires were available for participants to access electronically, and they were allowed to complete the experiment from anywhere with the Internet through Qualtrics. To ensure participants were properly informed, both an introduction and a debriefing were included within the online form. Participants were randomly assigned to complete a nonrandomized or randomized version of the survey. Nonrandomized questionnaires followed the original scale question order, consistent with paper delivery format. A different group of participants were given each question in a randomized order within each scale (i.e. all PIL and LPQ questions will still grouped together on one page). The order of administration of the two scales was randomized across participants for both groups. Once collected, the results were then amalgamated into a database for statistical analysis.

# Results

## Hypotheses and Data-Analytic Plan
Computer forms were analyzed by randomized and nonrandomized groups to examine the impact of randomization on equivalence through correlation matrices, factor loadings, item means, and total scores. We expected to find that these forms may potentially vary across correlation structure and item means, which would indicate differences in reactivity and item context to questions [i.e., item four always has item three as a precursor on a nonrandom form, while item four may have a different set of answers when prefaced with other questions; Knowlescontext]. Factor loadings were assessed to determine if differences in randomization caused a change in focus, such that participant interpretation of the item changed the relationship to the latent variable [@Buchanan2005]. However, we did not predict if values would change, as latent trait measurement should be consistent. Last, we examined total scores; however, it was unclear if these values would change. A difference in item means may result in changes in total scores, but may also result in no change if some item means decrease, while others increase. 

Each hypothesis was therefore tested using four dependent measures. First, we examined the correlation matrix for each type of delivery and compared the matrices to each other by using the *cortest.mat* function in the *psych* package [CITE]. This test provides a $\chi^2$ value that represents the difference between a pair of correlation matrices. If this value was significant, we followed up by exploring the differences between correlations individually using Fisher's r to z transformation. Each pair of correlations (i.e., random $r_{12}$ versus nonrandom $r_{12}$) was treated as an independent correlation and the difference between them was calculated by:

$$
Z_{difference} = \frac{(Z_{1} â€“ Z_{2})} { \sqrt{ \frac{1} {N_{1} â€“ 3} + \frac{1} {N_{2} â€“ 3}} }
$$
Critical $Z_{difference}$ was considered +/- 1.96 for this analysis, and all values are provided online on our OSF page.

We then conducted an exploratory factor analysis on both scales using one-factor models to examine the loading of each item on its latent trait. The PIL factor structure is contested [@Strack2009] with many suggestions as to latent structure for one- and two-factor models. The LPQ has seen less research on factor structure [@Schulenberg2004]. This paper focused on loadings on one global latent trait to determine if the manipulation of delivery impacted factor loadings. We used a one-factor model and included all questions to focus on the loadings, rather than the factor structure. The analysis was performed using the *psych* package in *R* with maximum likelihood estimation and an oblique (oblimin) rotation. The LPQ factor analysis used tetrachoric correlation structure to control for the dichotomous format of the scale, rather than traditional Pearson correlation structure. The loadings were then compared using a matched dependent *t*-test (i.e. item one to item one, item two to item two) to examine differences between nonrandomized and randomized computer samples. 

Next, item averages were calculated across all participants for each item. These 20 items were then compared in a matched dependent *t*-test to determine if delivery changed the mean of the item on the PIL or LPQ. While correlation structure elucidates the varying relations between items, we may still find that item averages are pushed one direction or another by a change in delivery and still maintain the same correlation between items. If this test was significant, we examined the individual items across participants for large effect sizes, as the large sample sizes in this study would create significant *t*-test follow ups. 

Last, the total scores for each participant were compared across delivery type using an independent *t*-test. Item analyses allow a focus on specific items that may show changes, while total scores allow us to investigate if changes in delivery alter the overall score that is used in other analyses or possible clinical implications. For analyses involving *t*-tests, we provide multiple measures of evidentiary value so that researchers can weigh the effects of randomization on their own criterion. Recent research on $\alpha$ criteria has shown wide disagreement on the usefulness of *p*-values and set cut-off scores [@Benjamin2017; @Lakens2017]. Therefore, we sought to provide traditional null hypothesis testing results (*t*-tests, *p*-values) and supplement these values with effect sizes [*d* and non-central confidence intervals, @Cumming2014; @Buchanan2017; @Smithson2001], Bayes Factors [@Kass1995; @Morey2015b], and one-sided tests of equivalence [TOST, @Cribbie2004; @Lakens2017a; @Schuirmann1987; @Rogers1993]. 

For dependent *t* tests, we used the average standard deviation of each group as the denominator for *d* calculation as follows [@Cumming2012BOOK]:

$$
d_{av} = \frac {(M_1 -  M_2) } { \frac{SD_1 + SD_2 } {2} }
$$
This effect size for repeated measures was instead of the traditional $d_z$ formula, wherein mean differences are divided by the standard deviation of the difference scores [@Lakens2013]. The difference scores standard deviation is often much smaller than the average of the standard deviations of each level, which can create an upwardly biased effect size [@Cumming2014]. This bias can lead researchers to interpret larger effects for a psychological phenomenon than actually exist. @Lakens2013 recommends using $d_{av}$ over $d_z$ because $d_z$ can overestimate the effect size [see also, DUNLAP1996] and $d_{av}$ can be more comparable to between subjects designs *d* values. For independent *t* tests, we used the $d_s$ formula [@Cohen1998]: 

$$
d_s = \frac {(M_1 -  M_2) } { \sqrt{\frac{(N_1-1)SD_1 + (N_2-1)SD_2 } {N_1+N_2-2}} }
$$

The normal frequentist approach (NHST) focuses largely on significance and *p*-values, while Bayesian alternatives, such as Bayes Factors can be calculated [@Dienes2014; @Wagenmakers2007]. Within a Bayesian framework, one focuses on the uncertainty or probability of phenomena [LeeWagenmakers book]. Prior distributions are our uncertainty estimations of the distributions of our parameters of interest. These distributions are combined with the data collected to form the posterior distribution for these parameters. Because the Bayesian framework focuses on updating previous beliefs with the data collected to form new beliefs, any number of hypotheses may be tested [for a humorous example, see WagenmakersMoreyLee]. NHST methods are traditionally used to examine the differences that exist in a set of data from a null or nil hypothesis [Cohen1994], determining if the change found in a study is greater than the likelihood of no change. A Bayesian version of significance testing may be calculated by using model comparison through Bayes Factors [EtzWagenmakers2015; @Kass1995; @Rouder2009]. Bayes Factors are calculated as a ratio of the marginal likelihood of two models. Bayes Factors provide a numeric value for how likely one model is over another model, much like likelihood or odds ratios. 

Here, Bayes Factors are calculated as the likelihood of the observed data under the alternative hypothesis divided by the likelihood of the data with the null hypothesis. The alternative model is generally considered a model wherein means between groups or items differ, and this model is compared to a null model of no mean differences. The resulting ratio is therefore the odds of the alternative model to the null, where BF values less than one indicate evidence for the null, values at one indicate even evidence for the null and alternative, and values larger than one indicate evidence for the alternative model. While some researchers have posed labels for BF values [@Kass1995], we present these values as a continuum to allow researchers to make their own decisions [@Morey2015b; @Morey2015c]. The advantage to this approach is the ability to show that the null model is just as, or more likely, than the alternative model, while NHST approaches have been criticized for an inability to test the null hypothesis [Gallistel2009]. 

Specifically, we used the *BayesFactor* package [@Morey2015b] with the recommended default priors that cover a wide range of data [@Morey2015b; @Rouder2009; Ly,Verhagen,Wagenmakers] of a Jeffreys prior with a fixed rscale (0.5) and random rscale (1.0). The choice of prior distribution can heavily influence the posterior belief, in that uninformative priors allow the data to comprise the posterior distribution. However, most researchers have a background understanding of their field, thus, making completely uninformative priors a tenuous assumption. Because of the dearth of literature in this field, there is not enough previous information to create a strong prior distribution, which would suppress the effect of the data on posterior belief. Therefore, we used the default options in *BayesFactor* to model this belief. 

Using Bayes Factors, we may be able to show evidence of the absence of an effect. Often, non-significant *p*-values from a NHST analysis are misinterpreted as evidence for the null hypothesis [@Lakens2017a]. However, we can use the traditional frequentist approach to determine if an effect is within a set of equivalence bounds. We used the two one-sided tests approach to specify a range of raw-score equivalence that would be considered supportive of the null hypothesis (i.e. no worthwhile effects or differences). TOST are then used to determine if the values found are outside of the equivalence range. Significant TOST values indicate that the effects are *within* the range of equivalence. We used the *TOSTER* package [@Lakens2017a] to calculate these values, and graphics created from this package can be found online at https://osf.io/gvx7s/. This manuscript was written in *R* markdown with the *papaja* package [@R-papaja], and this document, the data, and all scripts used to calculate our statistics are avaliable on the OSF page. 

The equivalence ranges are often tested by computing an expected effect size of negligible range; however, the TOST for dependent *t* uses $d_z$, which can overestimate the effect size of a phenomena [@Cumming2014; @Lakens2013]. Therefore, we calculated TOST tests on raw score differences to alleviate the overestimation issues. For EFA, we used a change score of .10 in the loadings, as @Comrey1992 suggested loading estimation ranges, such as .32 (poor) to .45 (fair) to .55 (good), and the differences in these ranges are approximately .10 [as cited in @Tabachnick2012, p. 654]. Additionally, this score would amount to a small correlation change using traditional guidelines for interpretation of *r* [@Cohen1992a]. For item and total score differences, we chose a 5% change in magnitude as the raw score cut off as a modest raw score change. To calculate that change for total scores, we used the following formula:

$$
(Max*N_{Questions} - Min*N_{Questions}) * Change
$$
Minimum and maximum values indicate the lower and upper end of the answer choices (i.e. 1 and 7), and change represented the proportion magnitude change expected. Therefore, for total PIL scores, we proposed a change in 6 points to be significant, while LPQ scores would change 1 point to be a significant change. For item analyses, we divided the total score change by the number of items to determine how much each item should change to impact the total score a significant amount (PIL = 0.30, LPQ = .05).

As discussed in the introduction, another approach to measuring equivalence would be through a MGCFA framework, analyzing measurement invariance. Those analyses were calculated as a supplement to the analyses described above and a summary is provided online. The original goal of this project was to calculate potential reactivity to item order through analyses that would be accessible to most researchers using questionnaires in their research. MGCFA requires not only specialized knowledge, but also specific software and the associated learning curve. We used *R* in our analyses, however, all analyses presented can be recreated with free software. The writers of *BayesFactor* have published online calculators for their work at http://pcl.missouri.edu/bayesfactor, and BF values are also avaliable in JASP [CITEJASP]. The TOST analyses may be calculated using an Excel spreedsheet avaliable from the author at https://osf.io/qzjaj/ or as an add-in module in the program jamovi [CITEJAMOVI]. Both JASP and jamovi are user friendly programs that researchers familiar with point and click software like Excel or SPSS will be able to use with ease. 

## Data Screening 
Each dataset was analyzed separately by splitting on scale and randomization, and first, all data were screened for accuracy and missing data. Participants with more than 5% missing data (i.e., 2 or more items) were excluded. Data were imputed using the *mice* package in *R* for participants with less than 5% of missing data [@VanBuuren2011]. Next, each dataset was examined for multivariate outliers using Mahalanobis distance [@Tabachnick2012]. Each dataset was then screened for multivariate assumptions of additivity, linearity, normality, homogeneity, and homoscedasticity. While some data skew was present, large sample sizes allowed for the assumption of normality of the sampling distribution. Information about the number of excluded data points in each step is presented in Table \@ref(tab:demo-table).

## PIL Analyses

### Correlation Matrices

```{r Cortest.matPIL, include = FALSE}
options(scipen = 999)

cor_notrandomP = cor(finalnotrandomP, use="pairwise")
cor_randomP = cor(finalrandomP, use="pairwise")

cortestPIL = cortest.mat(cor_notrandomP, cor_randomP, 
            n1 = nrow(finalnotrandomP), n2 = nrow(finalrandomP))

z_notrandomP = fisherz(cor_notrandomP)
z_randomP = fisherz(cor_randomP)
z_differenceP = (z_notrandomP - z_randomP) / sqrt((1/(nrow(finalnotrandomP) - 3)) + (1/(nrow(finalrandomP) - 3)))

#Zobserved = (z1 â€“ z2) / (square root of [ (1 / N1 â€“ 3) + (1 / N2 â€“ 3) ]
write.csv(z_differenceP, "z_differenceP.csv", row.names = F)
diffPIL = sum(abs(z_differenceP) > 1.96, na.rm = T) / 2
```

The correlation matrices for the randomized and nonrandomized versions of the PIL were found to be significantly different, $\chi^2$(`r cortestPIL$df`) = `r printnum(cortestPIL$chi2)`, *p* < .001. The *Z* score differences were examined, and `r diffPIL` correlations were different across the possible 190 tests. A summary of differences can be found in Table \@ref(tab:cor-table). For each item, the total number of differences was calculated, as shown in column two, and those specific items are listed in column three. Next, we summarized if the item had effects more on the items that would come before or after the item in a nonrandom format, as Knolwescontext has suggested that the items after a question should experience context effects. We additionally added information on if an item directly effected the next item (i.e., one and two are different), as strong reactions might have a more immediate impact. The last two columns summarize the directions of these effects. Positive *Z*-scores indicated stronger correlations between nonrandomized items, while negative *Z*-scores indicated stronger correlations for randomized items (summarized in the last column). Two items had strong context effects (i.e., impacted many items), item 2 *exciting life* and item 15 *prepared for death*. Interestingly, the impact is the reverse for these two items, as item 2 showed stronger relationships to items when randomized, while item 15 showed stronger relationships to items when nonrandomized. 

```{r cor-table, echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
cor_table = read.csv("CorrCompFullTable.csv")
apa_table(cor_table,
          align = c("l", rep("c", 5)),
          caption = "Correlation Matrices Results by Item",
          col.names = c("Item", "Differences", "Items Changed", "Where Changed", 
                        "Item Directly After", "Direction of Change", 
                        "Items Stronger Randomized")
          )
```

                         m2 = mean(FLnotP$loadings[1:20]),
                         sd1 = sd(FLrandomP$loadings[1:20]),
                         sd2 = sd(FLnotP$loadings[1:20]),

##note I hard coded the p values for TOST and BF, need to change if we change things. 
```

Table \@ref(tab:Ptable) includes the factor loadings from the one-factor EFA analysis. These loadings were compared using a dependent *t*-test matched on item, and they were not significantly different, `r apa_print(FLPt)$full_result`. The effect size for this test was correspondingly negligible, $d_{av}$ = `r apa(FLPd$d, 2)` 95% CI [`r apa(FLPd$dlow, 2)`, `r apa(FLPd$dhigh, 2)`]. The TOST test was significant for both the lower, *t*(19) = `r apa(FLPtost$TOST_t1, 2)`, *p* < .001 and the upper bound, *t*(19) = `r apa(FLPtost$TOST_t2, 2)`, *p* < .001. This result indicated that the change score was within the confidence band of expected negligible changes. Lastly, the BF for this test was 0.24, which indicated support for the null model. 

### Item Means

##means and sds for the table

SDnrP = apply(finalnotrandomP, 2, sd)

cutoff = ((maxscale*noq - minscale*noq) * perchange) / noq

IPtost = TOSTpaired.raw(n = length(MnrP),
                         m1 = mean(MnrP),
                         m2 = mean(MrP),
                         sd1 = sd(MnrP),
                         sd2 = sd(MrP),
                         r12 = cor(MnrP, MrP),
                         low_eqbound = -cutoff,
                         high_eqbound = cutoff,
                         alpha = .05)

##bayes factor
IPbf = ttestBF(x = MnrP, y = MrP, paired = T)
```

Table \@ref(tab:Ptable) includes the means and standard deviation of each item from the PIL scale. The item means were compared using a dependent *t*-test matched on item. Item means were significantly different `r apa_print(IPt)$full_result`. The effect size for this difference was small, $d_{av}$ = `r apa(IPd$d, 2)` 95% CI [`r apa(IPd$dlow, 2)`, `r apa(IPd$dhigh, 2)`]. Even though the *t*-test was significant, the TOST test indicated that the difference was within the range of a 5% percent change in item means (`r apa(cutoff, 2)`). The TOST test for lower bound, *t*(19) = `r apa(IPtost$TOST_t1, 2)`, *p* < .001 and the upper bound, *t*(19) = `r apa(IPtost$TOST_t2, 2)`, *p* < .001, suggested that the significant *t*-test may be not be interpreted as a meaningful change on the item means. The BF value for this test indicated 6.86 <0.01%, which is often considered weak evidence for the alternative model. Here, we find mixed results, indicating that randomization may change item means for the PIL.

Total scores were created by summing the items for each participant across all twenty PIL questions. The mean total score for nonrandomized testing was *M* = `r apa(MTnrP, 2)` (*SD* = `r apa(SDTnrP, 2)`) with excellent reliability ($\alpha$ = 0.93), while the mean for randomizing testing was *M* = `r apa(MTrP, 2)` (*SD* = `r apa(SDTrP, 2)`) with excellent reliability ($\alpha$ = 0.92). This difference was examined with an independent *t*-test and was not significant, `r apa_print(TPt)$statistic`. The effect size for this difference was negligible, $d_{av}$ = `r apa(TPd$d, 2)` 95% CI [`r apa(TPd$dlow, 2)`, `r apa(IPd$dhigh, 2)`]. We tested if scores were changed by 5% (`r apa(totcutoff, 2)` points), and the TOST test indicated that the lower, *t*(1897) = `r apa(TPtost$TOST_t1, 2)`, *p* < .001 and the upper bound, *t*(1897) = `r apa(TPtost$TOST_t2, 2)`, *p* < .001 were within this area of null change. The BF results also supported the null model, 0.25.

## LPQ Analyses

### Correlation Matrices 

```{r Cortest.matLPQ, include = FALSE}
## cortest.mat(R1,R2=NULL,n1=NULL,n2 = NULL) 

cor_notrandomL = cor(finalnotrandomL, use="pairwise")
cor_randomL = cor(finalrandomL, use="pairwise")
cortestLPQ = cortest.mat(cor_notrandomL, cor_randomL, 
            n1 = nrow(finalnotrandomL), n2 = nrow(finalrandomL))

z_notrandomL = fisherz(cor_notrandomL)
z_randomL = fisherz(cor_randomL)
z_differenceL = (z_notrandomL - z_randomL) / sqrt((1/(nrow(finalnotrandomL) - 3)) + (1/(nrow(finalrandomL) - 3)))

#Zobserved = (z1 â€“ z2) / (square root of [ (1 / N1 â€“ 3) + (1 / N2 â€“ 3) ]
write.csv(z_differenceL, "z_differenceL.csv", row.names = F)
diffLPQ = sum(abs(z_differenceL) > 1.96, na.rm = T) / 2

```

Mirroring the results for the PIL, the correlation matrices for the randomized and nonrandomized versions of the LPQ were significantly different, $\chi^2$(`r cortestLPQ$df`) = `r printnum(cortestLPQ$chi2)`, *p* < .001. Less differences in correlation were found, only `r diffLPQ` out of the possible 190 combinations. The differences are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:cor-table). Most of the items affected one to four other items with item 13 *reliable person* showing the largest number of differences in correlation. All these changes were positive, meaning the correlations were larger for nonrandomized versions. 

### Factor Loadings

```{r Lfactor-load, include = FALSE}
FLnotL= fa(finalnotrandomL, nfactors = 1, rotate = "oblimin", fm = "ml", cor = "tet")
FLrandomL = fa(finalrandomL, nfactors = 1, rotate = "oblimin", fm = "ml", cor = "tet")

FLLdz = d.dep.t.diff(mean(FLrandomL$loadings[1:20] - FLnotL$loadings[1:20]),
                     sd(FLrandomL$loadings[1:20] - FLnotL$loadings[1:20]), 
                     length(FLrandomL$loadings[1:20]),

                         m2 = mean(FLnotL$loadings[1:20]),
                         sd1 = sd(FLrandomL$loadings[1:20]),
                         sd2 = sd(FLnotL$loadings[1:20]),
                         r12 = cor(FLrandomL$loadings[1:20], FLnotL$loadings[1:20]),
                         low_eqbound = -0.10,
                         high_eqbound = 0.10,
                         alpha = .05)

##bayes factor
FLLbf = ttestBF(x = FLrandomL$loadings[1:20], y = FLnotL$loadings[1:20], paired = TRUE)
```

Table \@ref(tab:Ltable) includes the factor loadings from the one-factor EFA analysis using tetrachoric correlations. The loadings from randomized and nonrandomized versions were compared using a dependent *t*-test matched on item, which indicated they were not significantly different, `r apa_print(FLLt)$full_result`. The difference found for this test was negligible, $d_{av}$ = `r apa(FLLd$d, 2)` 95% CI [`r apa(FLLd$dlow, 2)`, `r apa(FLLd$dhigh, 2)`]. The TOST test examined if any change was within .10 change, as described earlier. The lower, *t*(19) = `r apa(FLLtost$TOST_t1, 2)`, *p* < .001 and the upper bound, *t*(19) = `r apa(FLLtost$TOST_t2, 2)`, *p* < .001 were both significant, indicating that the change was within the expected change. Further, in support of the null model, the BF was 0.34. 

### Item Means

```{r Litem, include = FALSE}
##means and sds for the table

ILtost = TOSTpaired.raw(n = length(MnrL),
                         m1 = mean(MnrL),
                         m2 = mean(MrL),
                         sd1 = sd(MnrL),
                         sd2 = sd(MrL),
                         r12 = cor(MnrL, MrL),
                         low_eqbound = -cutoff,
                         high_eqbound = cutoff,
                         alpha = .05)

##bayes factor
ILbf = ttestBF(x = MnrL, y = MrL, paired = T)
```

Means and standard deviations of each item are presented in Table \@ref(tab:Ltable). We again matched items and tested if there was a significant change using a dependent *t*-test. The test was not significant, `r apa_print(ILt)$full_result`, and the corresponding effect size reflects how little these means changed, $d_{av}$ = `r apa(ILd$d, 2)` 95% CI [`r apa(ILd$dlow, 2)`, `r apa(ILd$dhigh, 2)`]. Using a 5% change criterion, items were tested to determine if they changed less than (`r apa(cutoff, 2)`). The TOST test indicated both lower, *t*(19) = `r apa(ILtost$TOST_t1, 2)`, *p* < .001 and the upper bound, *t*(19) = `r apa(ILtost$TOST_t2, 2)`, *p* < .001, were within the null range. The BF also supported the null model, 0.24.

LPQ total scores were created by summing the items for each participant. The mean total score for randomized testing was *M* = `r apa(MTrL, 2, F)` (*SD* = `r apa(SDTrL, 2, F)`), with good reliability ($\alpha$ = 0.82), and the mean for nonrandomized testing was *M* = `r apa(MTnrL, 2, F)` (*SD* = `r apa(SDTnrL, 2, F)`) and good reliability ($\alpha$ = 0.84). An independent *t*-test indicated that the testing did not change total score, `r apa_print(TLt)$statistic`. The effect size for this difference was negligible, $d_{av}$ = `r apa(TLd$d, 2)` 95% CI [`r apa(TLd$dlow, 2)`, `r apa(ILd$dhigh, 2)`]. The TOST test indicated that the scores were within a 5% (`r apa(totcutoff, 2)` points) change, lower: *t*(1627) = `r apa(TLtost$TOST_t1, 2)`, *p* < .001 and upper: *t*(1627) = `r apa(TLtost$TOST_t2, 2)`, *p* < .001.

# Discussion

As technology has advanced, initial research questioned the validity of online assessments versus paper assessments. With further investigation, several researchers discovered equivalence with regard to computer surveys compared with paper surveys [@Deutskens2006; @Lewis2009]. However, with the addition of technology, @Fang2012a suggested that individuals respond with more extreme scores in online surveys than in-person surveys due to the social-desirability effect. Research on equivalence is mixed in results for paper and computer, and our work is a first-step on examining survey equivalence on an individual item-level for different forms of computer delivery. The findings from the current study are similar to those of Knowlescontext, in that we found differences in correlation matrices when items were randomized versus nonrandomized. These differences may be attributted to the context of the items when randomized, as described by Salaneikcontext. When viewed through a meaning-change [Knowlescontext] or integration model [Rogers1974; Tourangeau1988], these differences may indicate that the context and background knowledge are shifting based on the order of the items presented. 

As items showed these order context effects, randomization may present a way to combat those effects where the context of items is equalized across participants. However, it is important to show that randomization does not change the relationship of items with that underlying factor, rather just the context in which these items are presented. In both the PIL and LPQ scales, the factor loadings were found to be equivalent with results supporting the null hypothesis. For the PIL, we did find support for differences in item means using *p*-value criterion and Bayes Factor analyses. However, the effect size was small, meaning the differences were potentially not as meaningful as the *p*-values and BF analyses posit, in addition to considering the evidentiary values of the two one-sided tests, which supported the null range of expected values. Potentially, the small difference in item means was due to fluctuating context and order effects, with more change possible using a 1 to 7 item answer format (i.e., more possible range of answer change). The LPQ item means were not found to differ, and the correlational analysis showed less items changed in contrast to the PIL analysis. Finally, the total scores showed equivalence between randomization and nonrandomization which suggested that total scales were not considerably impacted with or without randomization of items. The match between results for two types of answer methodologies implied that randomization can be applied across a variety of scale types with similar effects. 

Since the PIL and LPQ analyses predominately illustrated support for null effects of randomization, item randomization of scales is of practical use when there are potential concerns about item order and context effects described by the meaning-change hypotheses. Randomization has been largely viewed as virtuous research practice in terms of sample selection and order of stimuli presentation for years; now, we must decide if item reactivity earns the same amount of caution that has been granted to existing research procedures. Since we found equivalence in terms of overall scoring of the PIL and LPQ, we advise that randomization should and can be used as a control mechanism, in addition to the ease of comparison between the scales if one researcher decided to randomize and one did not. Moreover, these results would imply that if an individual's total score on the PIL or LPQ is significantly different on randomized versus nonrandomized administrations, it is likely due to factors unrelated to delivery. Future research should investigate if this result is WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic), as this study focused on college-age students in the Midwest [@Henrich2010]. As @Fang2012â€™s research indicates different effects for collectivistic cultures, other cultures may show different results based on randomization. Additionally, one should consider the effects of potential computer illiteracy on online surveys [@Charters2004]. 

A second benefit to using the procedures outlined in this paper to examine for differences in methodology is the simple implementation of the analyses. While our analyses were performed in *R*, nearly all of these analyses can be performed in free point and click software, such as *jamovi* and *JASP*. Multigroup confirmatory factory analyses can additionally be used to analyze a very similar set of questions [@Brown2006]; however, multigroup analyses require a specialized skill and knowledge set. Bayes Factor and TOST analyses are included in these free programs and are easy to implement. In this paper, we have provided examples of how to test the null hypothesis, as well as ways to include multiple forms of evidentiary value to critically judge an analysis on facets other than *p*-values [@Valentine2017].
