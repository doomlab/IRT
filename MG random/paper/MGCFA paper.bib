A 2 (mode of presentation: paper-and- pencil – computerized)2 (technical level of the job: high technical job–low technical job)2 (selection decision: rejected or selected) between subjects design was used to assess proposed relationships between reactions to tests, their antecedents, and their consequences. While test-takers' post-test perceptions did not significantly differ as a result of mode of administration, computer anxiety and experience with computing were important factors in performing successfully. Significant relationships were found between post-feedback reactions and test-takers' intentions. The discussion highlights implications for implementing computerized selection tools.},

abstract = {Internet-mediated psychological assessment procedures can play an important role in behavioral telehealth, but their use is not unproblematic. Possible uses of World Wide Web-based tests are discussed. Published empirical evaluations of Web-based personality tests indicate that they can be reliable and valid. However, evidence exists that Web-based versions of tests may not always measure the same constructs as their traditional antecedents: Equivalence cannot be assumed. Web-based clinical assessment seems viable, but there are potential difficulties with measurement of some constructs (particularly negative affect), as well as ethical considerations. While offering great potential, online tests of clinical constructs require stringent validation and cautious use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA ) (journal abstract)},

@article{Weigold2013,
abstract = {Self-report survey-based data collection is increasingly carried out using the Internet, as opposed to the traditional paper-and-pencil method. However, previous research on the equivalence of these methods has yielded inconsistent findings. This may be due to methodological and statistical issues present in much of the literature, such as nonequivalent samples in different conditions due to recruitment, participant self-selection to conditions, and data collection procedures, as well as incomplete or inappropriate statistical procedures for examining equivalence. We conducted 2 studies examining the equivalence of paper-and-pencil and Internet data collection that accounted for these issues. In both studies, we used measures of personality, social desirability, and computer self-efficacy, and, in Study 2, we used personal growth initiative to assess quantitative equivalence (i.e., mean equivalence), qualitative equivalence (i.e., internal consistency and intercorrelations), and auxiliary equivalence (i.e., response rates, missing data, completion time, and comfort completing questionnaires using paper-and-pencil and the Internet). Study 1 investigated the effects of completing surveys via paper-and-pencil or the Internet in both traditional (i.e., lab) and natural (i.e., take-home) settings. Results indicated equivalence across conditions, except for auxiliary equivalence aspects of missing data and completion time. Study 2 examined mailed paper-and-pencil and Internet surveys without contact between experimenter and participants. Results indicated equivalence between conditions, except for auxiliary equivalence aspects of response rate for providing an address and completion time. Overall, the findings show that paper-and-pencil and Internet data collection methods are generally equivalent, particularly for quantitative and qualitative equivalence, with nonequivalence only for some aspects of auxiliary equivalence.},
